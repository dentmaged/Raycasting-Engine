I started this project to learn more about software based, Wolfenstein-esque raytracing. I am following the excellent article by F. Permadi here: www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/index.html

Please feel free to wade through my awful code to see if you can find anything useful or interesting if you too are interested in the magic of raytracing.

Also, please leave suggestions as to how my code can be improved, It would really help me, and other people out, and do not be afraid to ask questions if you are wondering how any of this project works.

Thanks, Shane O' Malley
